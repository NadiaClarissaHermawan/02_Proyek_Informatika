## Project Details :

A Challenge from [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/b8ac049a-6b43-490f-a0c8-ad5aaea02d45) website to create an android app in Kotlin to sell second-hand electronic products which are not needed by their owners. This application can show the name, category, thumbnail, price, and condition of the product being sold. Then the name, product, and condition can be sorted ascending/descending. Users can also search for the desired product name in the search field and can filter products by category. When the user presses a product, it will move to the product page which shows the image, name, price, category, condition and there is a button to add to the cart.

## Project Requirements : 
1. Products List Screen
   - We need to display the Products in list mode or tiles mode.
   - we need to display product name, product category, product thumbnails, product price, and product Condition.
   - The product name, product condition, product price should be sortable, such as click the 'Product name' header to sort products by product name ascending/descending order.
   - Show only 5 products when the screen loads.
   - A LOAD MOER button, clicking on it will load next 5 courses until no more products left.
   - Click on the product name of a row in list mode or a square in tiles mode, it will go to product details screen.
   - Provide a search box to search out for the product name.
   - Provide a select to filter products based on category.
2. Product Details Screen
   - Product name
   - Product images: show 3 images for a product and show them as carousel
   - Product category
   - Product price
   - Product condition: almost new, 90% new, etc.
   - A button to add this to shopping cart. For now, just show a toast how many items are in the cart and what the items are.
   - A back(<) button to return to products list screen
