## Project Details :

A Challenge from [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/b8ac049a-6b43-490f-a0c8-ad5aaea02d45) website to create an android app in Kotlin to sell second-hand electronic products which are not needed by their owners. This application can show the name, category, thumbnail, price, and condition of the product being sold. Then the name, product, and condition can be sorted ascending/descending. Users can also search for the desired product name in the search field and can filter products by category. When the user presses a product, it will move to the product page which shows the image, name, price, category, condition and there is a button to add to the cart.
